at Tenable, Steve has had worn a lot of hats and played a lot of roles within
various organizations.  Currently working as part of the Technology Alliances
team within Tenable, his goal is to work with various partners to help them
understand the Tenable platform APIs and steer them down the right path for
smooth integrations.

He has also written a lot of different pieces of software over the years, which
