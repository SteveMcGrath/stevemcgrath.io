Aside from a few hiccups that delayed getting Dofler installed and fully functional until mid-day Saturday, Dofler was a fantastical success at [CircleCityCon](http://circlecitycon.com)!  We discovered that the new codebase Dofler sits on was catching more entertainment than ever, including some MJPEG-based webcams:

In the evening, Dofler made it's way to the party and fun was had at a much larger scale ;).

Thanks to everyone who connected up and was purposefully trolling the board for everyone else's amusement!  See ya'll at BSidesLV!
