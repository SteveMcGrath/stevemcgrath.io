After running CUGNet for a dozen or so years and having yet to break even, last week I made the hard decision to close down CUGNet's VPS services.  It was a hard choice to make, as its something that I have done for many years, however with the propensity of cloud services and VPS providers out there, What I can offer is simply not competitive and the I need to start cutting down on the number of side projects that I have been running in order to keep my own sanity.  I will be keeping the VPS services up and running at least past DefCon, however after that point the servers will eventually be shut down and the hardware de-racked.  It's been a long run for CUGNet, however as with anything else, all good things must eventually come to an end.
