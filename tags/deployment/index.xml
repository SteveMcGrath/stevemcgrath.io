      <description>I have started working through all of the various fabric files I have and started centralizing them and cleaning them up for general consumption. These fabric scripts cover a variety of tasks from deployment and maintenance of various products to deploying some of my code. I will be updating the repository as needs arise, and as always am welcome to any input.
Using my fabric files is actually pretty simple, however you need to have fabric installed on your workstation before anything will work.</description>
