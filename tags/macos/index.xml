      <description>I have been asked many times over the year how I have my python development environment setup, and while some of the tooling has changed a little over the years, the changes have been surprisingly minor. I figured it was about time to document what I&amp;rsquo;m using, and how I have it all setup.
What I Use I have been using a Mac as my primary workstation since some time in 2004, so I will warn that some of this tooling is fairly MacOS specific, however most of it should be usable regardless of the operating system you&amp;rsquo;re on.</description>
