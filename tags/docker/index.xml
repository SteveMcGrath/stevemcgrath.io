      <description>A lot of the Nessus Scanner docker images in Docker Hub don&amp;rsquo;t appear to be properly parameterizing a lot (or in many cases, any) of the required inputs to really get the scanner to run and connect up in an automated fashion. Further most of the images that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen out there aren&amp;rsquo;t cleaning up the identifying information the scanner created as part of install (such as the UUID, the master encryption key, etc.</description>

      <description>With all of the materials out there on the web revolving around docker containers, I thought that getting some sort of a docker network that containers could promiscuously sniff would have been a relatively easy thing to find. I was shocked to find out that, not only was this not the case, but that the general consensus was that you need to use either Docker&amp;rsquo;s host networking (which means that these containers can&amp;rsquo;t exist in other network name-spaces), use pass-through networking (which unless you have hardware that support SR-IOV, your out of luck), or that you resort to some serious host hacking to get the interface into the container.</description>
