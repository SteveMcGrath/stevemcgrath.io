      <description>With all of the materials out there on the web revolving around docker containers, I thought that getting some sort of a docker network that containers could promiscuously sniff would have been a relatively easy thing to find. I was shocked to find out that, not only was this not the case, but that the general consensus was that you need to use either Docker&amp;rsquo;s host networking (which means that these containers can&amp;rsquo;t exist in other network namespaces), use passthrough networking (which unless you have hardware that support SR-IOV, your out of luck), or that you resort to some serious host hacking to get the interface into the container.</description>
