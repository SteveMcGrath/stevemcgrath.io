      <description>After running CUGNet for a dozen or so years and having yet to break even, last week I made the hard decision to close down CUGNet&amp;rsquo;s VPS services. It was a hard choice to make, as its something that I have done for many years, however with the propensity of cloud services and VPS providers out there, What I can offer is simply not competitive and the I need to start cutting down on the number of side projects that I have been running in order to keep my own sanity.</description>
